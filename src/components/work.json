There are three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. The size of the table and the tiles within them are the key differences between them. Easy is 4x4, medium is 6x6, and hard is 8x8. You can aim for a high score while running away from the timer using a scoreboard that resets after the session (limitations of the student project).",
